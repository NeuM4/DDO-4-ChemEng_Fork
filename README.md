# DDO-4-ChemEng ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the DDO-4-ChemEng repository! 

Repository for the book chapter "Data-Driven Optimization for Chemical Processes: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" ðŸ“š

## arXiv Link: Coming Soon!

### Benchmarking ðŸ“‚
Both unconstrained and constrained optimisation problems based on mathematical functions and chemical engineering case studies such as PID tuning are treated. The benchmarking procedure compares state-of-the-art DDO algorithms.

### Quick Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
